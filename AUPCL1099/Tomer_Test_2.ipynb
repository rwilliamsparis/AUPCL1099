      "very frequently asked me--\"How I, when a young girl, came to think of,\n",
      "and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?\" It is true that I am very\n",
      "averse to bringing myself forward in print; but as my account will only\n",

      "the latter I was a close imitator--rather doing as others had done,\n",
      "than putting down the suggestions of my own mind. What I wrote was\n",
      "intended at least for one other eye--my childhood's companion and\n",
      "friend; but my dreams were all my own; I accounted for them to nobody;\n",
      "they were my refuge when annoyed--my dearest pleasure when free.\n",

      "I lived principally in the country as a girl, and passed a considerable\n",
